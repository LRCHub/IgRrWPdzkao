[00:00.18] Try to see it my way
[00:02.65] Do I have to keep on talking 'til I can't go on?
[00:07.22] While you see it your way
[00:09.61] Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
[00:14.12] We can work it out
[00:16.40] We can work it out
[00:25.40] 
[00:18.87] Think of what you're saying
[00:21.25] You can get it wrong and still you think that it's all right
[00:25.84] Think of what I'm saying
[00:28.12] We can work it out, and get it straight or say good night
[00:32.55] We can work it out
[00:34.80] We can work it out
[00:43.80] 
[00:37.28] Life is very short
[00:40.26] And there's no time
[00:44.78] For fussing and fighting, my friend
[00:50.54] I have always thought that it's a crime
[00:58.08] So I will ask you once again
[01:12.08] 
[01:03.82] Try to see it my way
[01:06.35] Only time will tell if I am righ, or I am wrong
[01:10.76] While you see it your way
[01:13.01] There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
[01:17.15] We can work it out
[01:19.55] We can work it out
[01:28.55] 
[01:21.53] Life is very short
[01:24.68] And there's no time
[01:29.04] For fussing and fighting, my friend
[01:34.99] I have always thought that it's a crime
[01:41.92] So I will ask you once again
[01:55.92] 
[01:47.94] Try to see it my way
[01:50.28] Only time will tell If I am right, or I am wrong
[01:54.45] While you see it your way
[01:56.93] There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
[02:01.03] We can work it out
[02:03.28] We can work it out
